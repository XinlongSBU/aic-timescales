  abstract = {{Final evolution of the stars in the mass range of 8-12M has been investigated fully taking account of the effects of electron captures and oxygen deflagration. Only an 0-Ne-Mg core has been treated numerically from the stages well in advance of electron captures and of oxygen burning. It is found that a convective core is formed as a result of entropy production by the electron captures on $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne. It delays the onset of the oxygen deflagration to a stage with the central density as high as 2.5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Because of such high densities beta processes overcome the oxygen deflagration and the core continues to contract quasi-dynamically. Behind the deflagration front the core material is processed into nuclear statistical equilibrium, from which energy is being lost by the processes of the electron captures, the photodissociations of nuclei, and the neutron drips. The total, i.e., the gravitational plus thermal energy of the core is decreasing at an appreciable rate. Though the numerical computation was stopped at the central density of 1 {\times} 10$^{11}$ g cm$^{-3}$, it is likely that the contraction continues to form a neutron star. }},

  abstract = {{The density at which electron capture can ignite oxygen burning in 8-10 solar mass stars is investigated within the uncertainties of the semiconvection theory. The Ledoux criterion for convection is adopted in order to take into account the maximum effect of heating due to electron capture. It is found that oxygen burning is not ignited by electron captures on Mg-24 and Na-24 at the central density of about 4 x 10 to the 9th g/cu cm, but by capture on Ne-20 at about 1 x 10 to the 10th g/cu cm. This ignition density is 2.5 times lower than in the case with the Schwarzschild criterion, but is still high enough to induce a collapse by electron capture rather than a total explosion of the core. When the oxygen-burning front arrives at M(r) of roughly 0.3 solar mass, the contraction reaches a quasi-dynamic collapse. }},

  abstract = {{We provide progenitor models for electron capture supernovae (ECSNe) with detailed evolutionary calculation. We include minor electron capture nuclei using a large nuclear reaction network with updated reaction rates. For electron capture, the Coulomb correction of rates is treated and the contribution from neutron-rich isotopes is taken into account in each nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) composition. We calculate the evolution of the most massive super asymptotic giant branch stars and show that these stars undergo off-center carbon burning and form ONe cores at the center. These cores become heavier up to the critical mass of 1.367 M $_{&sun;}$ and keep contracting even after the initiation of O+Ne deflagration. Inclusion of minor electron capture nuclei causes convective URCA cooling during the contraction phase, but the effect on the progenitor evolution is small. On the other hand, electron capture by neutron-rich isotopes in the NSE region has a more significant effect. We discuss the uniqueness of the critical core mass for ECSNe and the effect of wind mass loss on the plausibility of our models for ECSN progenitors. }},

  abstract = {{We study the evolution of accreting oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs), with a particular emphasis on the effects of the presence of the carbon-burning products $^{23}$Na and $^{25}$Mg. These isotopes lead to substantial cooling of the WD via the $^{25}$Mg-$^{25}$Na, $^{23}$Na-$^{23}$Ne and $^{25}$Na-$^{25}$Ne Urca pairs. We derive an analytic formula for the peak Urca-process cooling rate and use it to obtain a simple expression for the temperature to which the Urca process cools the WD. Our estimates are equally applicable to accreting carbon-oxygen WDs. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution code to evolve a suite of models that confirm these analytic results and demonstrate that Urca-process cooling substantially modifies the thermal evolution of accreting ONe WDs. Most importantly, we show that MESA models with lower temperatures at the onset of the $^{24}$Mg and $^{24}$Na electron captures develop convectively unstable regions, even when using the Ledoux criterion. We discuss the difficulties that we encounter in modelling these convective regions and outline the potential effects of this convection on the subsequent WD evolution. For models in which we do not allow convection to operate, we find that oxygen ignites around a density of log({$\rho$}$_{c}$/g cm$^{-3}$) {\ap} 9.95, very similar to the value without Urca cooling. Nonetheless, the inclusion of the effects of Urca-process cooling is an important step in producing progenitor models with more realistic temperature and composition profiles which are needed for the evolution of the subsequent oxygen deflagration and hence for studies of the signature of accretion-induced collapse. }},

  abstract = {{We study the evolution of degenerate electron cores primarily composed of the carbon burning products $^{16}$O, $^{20}$Ne, and $^{24}$Mg (hereafter ONeMg cores) that are undergoing compression. Electron capture reactions on A = 20 and 24 isotopes reduce the electron fraction and heat the core. We develop and use a new capability of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution code that provides a highly accurate implementation of these key reactions. These new accurate rates and the ability of MESA to perform extremely small spatial zoning demonstrates a thermal runaway in the core triggered by the temperature and density sensitivity of the $^{20}$Ne electron capture reactions. Both analytics and numerics show that this thermal runaway does not trigger core convection, but rather leads to a centrally concentrated (r {\lt} km) thermal runaway that will subsequently launch an oxygen deflagration wave from the centre of the star. We use MESA to perform a parameter study that quantifies the influence of the $^{24}$Mg mass fraction, the central temperature, the compression rate, and uncertainties in the electron capture reaction rates on the ONeMg core evolution. This allows us to establish a lower limit on the central density at which the oxygen deflagration wave initiates of {$\rho$}$_{c}$ {\gsim} 8.5 {\times} 10$^{9}$ g cm$^{- 3}$. Based on previous work and order-of-magnitude calculations, we expect objects which ignite oxygen at or above these densities to collapse and form a neutron star. Calculations such as these are an important step in producing more realistic progenitor models for studies of the signature of accretion-induced collapse. }},

Electron capture induces a rapid contraction of the electron-degenerate O{\ndash}Ne{\ndash}Mg core. The outcome of rapid contraction depends on the evolutionary changes in the central density and temperature, which are determined by the competing processes of contraction, cooling, and heating. The fate of the stars is determined by these competitions, whether they end up with electron-capture supernovae or Fe core-collapse supernovae. Since the competing processes are induced by electron capture and {$\beta$}-decay, the accurate weak rates are crucially important. The rates are obtained for pairs with A = 20, 23, 24, 25, and 27 by shell-model calculations in the sd-shell with the USDB Hamiltonian. Effects of Coulomb corrections on the rates are evaluated. The rates for pairs with A = 23 and 25 are important for nuclear Urca processes that determine the cooling rate of the O{\ndash}Ne{\ndash}Mg core, while those for pairs with A = 20 and 24 are important for the core contraction and heat generation rates in the core. We provide these nuclear rates at stellar environments in tables with fine enough meshes at various densities and temperatures for studies of astrophysical processes sensitive to the rates. In particular, the accurate rate tables are crucially important for the final fates of not only O{\ndash}Ne{\ndash}Mg cores but also a wider range of stars, such as C{\ndash}O cores of lower-mass stars. }},
