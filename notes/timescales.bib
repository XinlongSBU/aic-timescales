  abstract = {{Final evolution of the stars in the mass range of 8-12M has been investigated fully taking account of the effects of electron captures and oxygen deflagration. Only an 0-Ne-Mg core has been treated numerically from the stages well in advance of electron captures and of oxygen burning. It is found that a convective core is formed as a result of entropy production by the electron captures on $^{24}$Mg and $^{20}$Ne. It delays the onset of the oxygen deflagration to a stage with the central density as high as 2.5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Because of such high densities beta processes overcome the oxygen deflagration and the core continues to contract quasi-dynamically. Behind the deflagration front the core material is processed into nuclear statistical equilibrium, from which energy is being lost by the processes of the electron captures, the photodissociations of nuclei, and the neutron drips. The total, i.e., the gravitational plus thermal energy of the core is decreasing at an appreciable rate. Though the numerical computation was stopped at the central density of 1 {\times} 10$^{11}$ g cm$^{-3}$, it is likely that the contraction continues to form a neutron star. }},

  abstract = {{The density at which electron capture can ignite oxygen burning in 8-10 solar mass stars is investigated within the uncertainties of the semiconvection theory. The Ledoux criterion for convection is adopted in order to take into account the maximum effect of heating due to electron capture. It is found that oxygen burning is not ignited by electron captures on Mg-24 and Na-24 at the central density of about 4 x 10 to the 9th g/cu cm, but by capture on Ne-20 at about 1 x 10 to the 10th g/cu cm. This ignition density is 2.5 times lower than in the case with the Schwarzschild criterion, but is still high enough to induce a collapse by electron capture rather than a total explosion of the core. When the oxygen-burning front arrives at M(r) of roughly 0.3 solar mass, the contraction reaches a quasi-dynamic collapse. }},

  abstract = {{We provide progenitor models for electron capture supernovae (ECSNe) with detailed evolutionary calculation. We include minor electron capture nuclei using a large nuclear reaction network with updated reaction rates. For electron capture, the Coulomb correction of rates is treated and the contribution from neutron-rich isotopes is taken into account in each nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) composition. We calculate the evolution of the most massive super asymptotic giant branch stars and show that these stars undergo off-center carbon burning and form ONe cores at the center. These cores become heavier up to the critical mass of 1.367 M $_{&sun;}$ and keep contracting even after the initiation of O+Ne deflagration. Inclusion of minor electron capture nuclei causes convective URCA cooling during the contraction phase, but the effect on the progenitor evolution is small. On the other hand, electron capture by neutron-rich isotopes in the NSE region has a more significant effect. We discuss the uniqueness of the critical core mass for ECSNe and the effect of wind mass loss on the plausibility of our models for ECSN progenitors. }},
